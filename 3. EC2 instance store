1. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
EBS is a high-performance, block-storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2. Think of it as a Network Attached Drive (HDD/SSD) that you plug into your virtual server.
Key Characteristic: It is Availability Zone (AZ) locked. An EBS volume created in us-east-1a cannot be attached to an EC2 instance in us-east-1b without a snapshot.
Network-Based: It is not physically attached to the host machine; it communicates with the EC2 instance over the AWS internal network.
Termination Policy: By default, the Root EBS volume is deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated (though you can disable this).
It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
• They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP
level)
• They are bound to a specific availability zone

2. EBS Snapshots
A Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of your EBS volume.
Incremental: AWS only saves the blocks that have changed since the last snapshot, making them cost-effective.
Storage Location: Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 (though you don't see them in your S3 buckets).
Cross-AZ/Region Mobility: This is the primary way to move a volume to a different AZ or Region. You take a snapshot, then "Restore" it as a new volume in a different zone.
• Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
• Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
delete
• Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin
• Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
• Force full initialization of snapsh

3. AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
An AMI is a customized unit that contains the software configuration (OS, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.
Relation to EBS: You create an AMI from a running instance or an EBS snapshot.
Components: It includes a template for the root volume, launch permissions, and block device mapping.
Global Reach: Like snapshots, AMIs can be copied across AWS Regions to enable global deployments.
• AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
• You can launch EC2 instances from:
  • A Public AMI: AWS provided
  • Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
  • An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

4. EC2 Instance Store
While EBS is "Network Storage," Instance Store is "Physical Storage."
Episodic/Ephemeral: Data is LOST if the instance is stopped or terminated. It only survives a reboot.
Performance: Because it is physically attached to the host server, it has much higher I/O speed (IOPS) and lower latency than EBS.
Use Case: Ideal for temporary storage, such as buffers, caches, and scratch data.
• Backups and Replication are your responsibility

5. EBS Volume Types
AWS offers different types based on performance and cost.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volume Type	                Name	                           Best For...	                                Max IOPS
gp3 / gp2	                 General Purpose SSD	             Boot volumes, dev/test environments.	        16,000
io2 / io1                	 Provisioned IOPS SSD	             Critical databases (High performance).	      64,000
st1	                       Throughput Optimized HDD	         Big Data, Data Warehousing, Log processing   500  
sc1	                       Cold HDD	                         Infrequently accessed data (Cheapest).      	250
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. EBS Multi-Attach
Normally, one EBS volume attaches to one EC2 instance. Multi-Attach breaks this rule.
-Capability: Allows you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS (io1 or io2) volume to up to 16 Nitro-based EC2 instances simultaneously.
-Requirement: All instances must be in the same Availability Zone.
-Use Case: Cluster-aware applications (like Teradata) where multiple nodes need concurrent access to the same storage.
• Each instance has full read & write permissions to the high-performance volume

7. EBS Encryption
Security is a top priority for the Solutions Architect exam.
Mechanism: Uses AWS KMS (Key Management Service) - AES-256.
What is Encrypted: Data at rest inside the volume, data in transit between EC2 and EBS, all snapshots, and all volumes created from those snapshots.
Performance: Encryption happens on the EC2 host, meaning there is minimal latency impact on EBS I/O.
• When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
    • Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
    •  All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
    • All snapshots are encrypted
    • All volumes created from the snapshot
• Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to
do)
• Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
• EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
• Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption
• Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted

8. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
EFS is a managed Network File System (NFS) that can be mounted on many EC2 instances at once.
Scalability: It scales automatically from petabytes down to zero; you only pay for what you use.
Regional Service: Unlike EBS, EFS is a Regional service. Instances from different AZs can connect to the same EFS file system simultaneously.
Compatibility: Works only with Linux-based AMI (use Amazon FSx for Windows).
• Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use

9. EFS vs. EBS: The Comparison
This is a high-probability exam question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature	                   Amazon EBS	                      Amazon EFS
Network Protocol	         Block Storage (Proprietary)	    File Storage (NFS)
Accessibility	             1 instance at a time (mostly)   	100s of instances simultaneously
Availability	             Locked to 1 AZ	                  Distributed across multiple AZs
Scaling	                   Manual resizing required	        Automatic scaling
Cost	                     Cheaper (Pay for provisioned)	  More expensive (Pay for use)
